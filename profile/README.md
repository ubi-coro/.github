# AG Collaborative Robotics - Bielefeld University

Welcome to the public page of the Collaborative Robotics Research Group led by Prof. Dr. Klaus Neumann. Our research group is a joint initiative of Bielefeld University and Fraunhofer IOSB-INA in Lemgo. We are part of the "Cognitive Interaction Technology" (CITEC) research center and the Faculty of Technology at Bielefeld University.

## About Us

The Collaborative Robotics Research Group focuses on the intuitive use of collaborative robotic systems in manipulation and assembly based on imitation learning. Our research focuses on:

- **Reconfigurable and modular robots**
- **Intelligent product transport**
- **Neural control and regulation of robots in safe interaction with human production participants**
- **Magnetic levitation systems and planar robotics**

Our goal is to develop innovative solutions for industrial automation and to optimize the collaboration between humans and machines.

## Research Projects and Publications
